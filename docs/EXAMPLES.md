Step 2/4: Confirmation
Do you understand that firmware protection will be lost? [yes/no]: yes

Step 3/4: Confirmation
Have you backed up your firmware? [yes/no]: yes

Step 4/4: Final Confirmation
Type 'REMOVE' to confirm removal: REMOVE

FINAL WARNING:
This is your last chance to cancel. Press Ctrl+C within 5 seconds...
(5 second countdown)

Scheduling removal...
✓ Removal scheduled successfully
⚠ The Recovery Core will be removed on the next system reboot.
⚠ Please reboot your system to complete the removal process.
```

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Operation

**Situation:** System running normally with SRC enabled

**What Happens:**
1. System boots successfully
2. Recovery Core detects boot success via GPIO/watchdog
3. Every 10 minutes, firmware is backed up to USB
4. Backups rotate: new → A.bin, old A → B.bin, old B deleted
5. System continues normal operation

**User Action:** None required (automatic)

### Scenario 2: Firmware Update Failure

**Situation:** Firmware update fails, system won't boot

**What Happens:**
1. System attempts to boot
2. Boot fails (no success signal within 30 seconds)
3. Recovery Core detects boot failure
4. USB device checked for presence
5. Recovery Core reads A.bin from USB
6. Signature verified
7. Firmware written to SPI flash
8. System reboots
9. System boots successfully from recovered firmware

**User Action:** None required (automatic recovery)

### Scenario 3: Temporary Maintenance

**Situation:** User needs to disable recovery temporarily for testing

**User Action:**
```bash
sudo security off 30m
# Perform testing
# Recovery automatically re-enables after 30 minutes
```

**What Happens:**
1. Recovery Core disabled for 30 minutes
2. System operates without recovery protection
3. After 30 minutes, recovery automatically re-enables
4. User receives warning when disabling

### Scenario 4: USB Device Removed

**Situation:** USB recovery device is unplugged

**What Happens:**
1. Backup operations skip (USB not present)
2. Recovery Core logs warning
3. System continues normal operation
4. If boot failure occurs, recovery cannot proceed (USB required)
5. User should reconnect USB device

**User Action:**
- Reconnect USB device
- Check `security status` to verify USB detected

### Scenario 5: Both Backups Corrupted

**Situation:** Both A.bin and B.bin have invalid signatures

**What Happens:**
1. Boot failure detected
2. Recovery attempts A.bin → signature fails
3. Recovery attempts B.bin → signature fails
4. Recovery aborts
5. System enters safe mode
6. Manual intervention required

**User Action:**
- Provide valid firmware backup on USB
- Or use platform-specific recovery tools

## Example USB Directory Structure

```
/SECURITY_RECOVERY/
├── A.bin              (8,388,608 bytes - current firmware)
├── B.bin              (8,388,608 bytes - previous firmware)
├── manifest.json      (256 bytes)
├── signature.sig      (512 bytes - ECDSA signature)
└── metadata.txt       (128 bytes)
```

### Example manifest.json

```json

  "board_id": "BOARD-12345",
  "backup_a": "A.bin",
  "backup_b": "B.bin",

}
```

### Example metadata.txt

## Example Installation Flow

```bash
$ sudo security install

============================================================
Security Recovery Core - Interactive Installation
============================================================

This tutorial will guide you through installing SRC.

Step 1: USB Recovery Device
----------------------------------------
You need a USB drive formatted as FAT32.
The drive must contain a /SECURITY_RECOVERY/ directory with:
  - A.bin (latest firmware backup)
  - B.bin (previous firmware backup)
  - manifest.json
  - signature.sig
  - metadata.txt

Have you prepared the USB device? [yes/no]: yes
✓ USB device found

Step 2: System Compatibility
----------------------------------------
Detected OS: Linux 6.18.4
Architecture: x86_64

Is your system compatible? [yes/no]: yes

Step 3: Installation Process
----------------------------------------
The installation will:
1. Flash Recovery Core firmware to reserved SPI region
2. Configure boot detection
3. Initialize backup system
4. Enable recovery protection

Proceed with installation? [yes/no]: yes

Installing Recovery Core...
✓ Installation complete

Enabling Recovery Core...
✓ Recovery Core enabled successfully

✓ Security Recovery Core is now active!

Your system is now protected against firmware bricking.
